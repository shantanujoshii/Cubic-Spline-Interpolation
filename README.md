# Cubic-Spline-Interpolation
This code demonstrates the cubic spline interpolation for any dataset. Here in this example which is coded in MATLAB, we are taking the datapoints for y=sin(x). 
We would use the tridiagonal matrix to solve for f''(x) and then use them to find the derivatives at any intermediate point between two particular xi's.
